```
Z3 = {0, 1, 2}
Z5 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Zn = {0, 1, 2, .., n-1}
```

## ZnGroup Interface:

- Constructor for the size of n
- `get_identity()` - returns the identity element
- `get_elements()` - returns a set of all elements
- `operation(a, b)` - performs `(a + b) % n`
- `inverse_of(x)` - returns the inverse element of x
- `exponent(a, n)` - returns `a^n`, which is achieved by the following rule:

```
a^1 = a
a^2 = a + a
a^3 = a + a + a
...
```

## Generators & Cyclic group

A generator of a group is a set, generated by the following rule:

```
<a> = {a ^ n | for n = 1 to ...}
```

We stop with the elements, when we get an element, that is already in the group.

If `<a> = Zn`, then Zn is cyclic group. (The element generates the entire set of the group.)


## Cayley Table

- Make it return & print Cayley Table for `Zn`
- Make it an HTML Table
- Make it pretty!
